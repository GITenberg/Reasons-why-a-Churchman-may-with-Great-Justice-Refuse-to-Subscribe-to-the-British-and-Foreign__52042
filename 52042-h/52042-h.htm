<h2><a name="pagei"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
i</span>PREFACE.</h2>
<p>As this small tract seems destined for a more extended
circulation, than was at first intended, from the author&rsquo;s
being strongly solicited that it might be made more public, it
may in some degree be necessary to explain his motive for its
original publication; lest it should seem to have been solely
brought forward, with a view of entering into the controversy
respecting Bible Societies.&nbsp; Which was certainly far from
the case, because he is of opinion, that though controversies
will, when conducted in an argumentative, dispassionate, and
manly manner, draw out and confirm the truth; yet, if conducted
otherwise, they more frequently tend to confuse others, but very
rarely to convince the parties engaged.&nbsp; His motive,
therefore, was very <a name="pageii"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
ii</span>different.&nbsp; Being minister of a populous parish,
and observing, what he conceived to be, an unwarrantable
interference in it, to assist and forward the views of the
British and Foreign Bible Society, though it was contrary to his
known and expressed wishes; he was, in a manner, compelled to
give his reasons to his parishioners, who were churchmen, why he
objected to that society; and to shew that his objection did not
arise, as the general insinuation is, because the Bible was
circulated, but because there was a society established, which,
to churchmen, afforded greater means of circulating it; and
which, also, held forth greater advantages and security to the
Established Church.&nbsp; His object was to keep the members of
the Established Church steady in their obedience to it; and to
put them on their guard against the invitations of the Bible
Society, which would only distract them.&nbsp; He has concisely
told them his reasons for forming this opinion, and has furnished
them with a reasonable excuse for not subscribing.</p>
<p>The author will now merely repeat, that, <a
name="pageiii"></a><span class="pagenum">p. iii</span>had it not
been for the solicitations of many of his friends, this tract
would have been confined to the use of his parishes.&nbsp; He
wishes, therefore, to observe, that, as that was his first
intention, and as he has not been in the habit of writing for the
press, he hopes he shall receive indulgence for its
imperfections.&nbsp; His desire was, that it might be useful to
those for whom it was at first intended; and he trusts it will be
equally so, when more widely diffused.</p>
<h2><a name="page1"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
1</span><i>REASONS</i>,<br />
&amp;c., &amp;c.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">From</span> the increased activity which
has of late been shewn by the advocates for the British and
Foreign Bible Society, and the reflections which have been cast
upon those who do not choose to join them, it seems necessary to
set this subject in its true light; and to shew that the refusal
to unite with them, is not, as they have falsely said, because
those who refuse are against the circulation of the Bible; but
because they foresee danger likely to be incurred by it; and
because there is another Bible Society, which was established
above 100 years before their&rsquo;s, and which holds out to its
subscribers, particularly churchmen, superior advantages; and,
therefore, a person may be thoroughly justified in the preference
of the one Society, and the rejection of the other.</p>
<p>Before, however, the subject is entered upon, it may be
necessary to say, that these observations are intended to be
addressed particularly to churchmen; and to that class of
churchmen, who have had neither leisure nor opportunity to attend
to the consideration of such subjects; but who yet may be
desirous of knowing the merits of them, if brought forward in a
concise manner.&nbsp; They are not intended to cast any reproach
on the dissenters, nor to adopt the arrogant and dogmatical style
of the Bible Society, and say, <a name="page2"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 2</span>that because a person thinks
differently, he is therefore deserving of every reproachful
epithet, he is unmindful of the eternal welfare of the poor, and
guilty of a total dereliction of his duty.&nbsp; This style is by
no means adapted to the temper or disposition of the writer of
these observations, who wishes to urge what he says, in a clear
and candid manner, void of all anger, bitterness, or
clamour.&nbsp; He being well convinced, that, if reason and sound
argument will not bring conviction to a man&rsquo;s mind, anger
or vehemence of expression will never effect it.&nbsp; For a good
cause only requires to be fairly stated to insure approbation;
whilst a bad cause, being fearful of not obtaining any support,
strives to snatch it by violence and declamation.</p>
<p>The chief arguments urged by the advocates of the British and
Foreign Bible Society, are the general circulation of the Bible;
and the love and harmony which an union of churchmen with
dissenters must, they say, naturally inspire.&nbsp; It will not,
however, be difficult to prove, that neither the one nor the
other can be exclusively claimed by them.&nbsp; That they cannot
appropriate the former solely to themselves; nor has the latter
been at all proved by recent occurrences.&nbsp; To prove that the
circulation of the Bible does not exclusively belong to the
British and Foreign Bible Society, it needs only be said, that
there is another Society for that purpose, called the Society for
Promoting Christian Knowledge.&nbsp; It is asserted by some, that
these two Societies will not interfere with, nor oppose, each
other.&nbsp; But how can this be proved, when, by the strong
recommendation of the one, and the total silence as to the other,
subscriptions <a name="page3"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
3</span>are drawn to the one, which might very materially assist
and increase the powers of the other, seems inexplicable.&nbsp;
If merely the distribution of the Bible were the sole effect to
be produced, and no other consequence to be apprehended, there
could be no possible objection to either, and it might not
signify through which channel it was carried.&nbsp; For the Bible
is the work of men divinely inspired, and contains every thing
which a Christian ought to know and believe to his soul&rsquo;s
health; and therefore, no book can be more proper, nor more
useful, nor deserve to be more freely nor more widely
circulated.&nbsp; But though it is a book which is so proper, so
useful, and deserves to be as freely and as widely circulated as
possible, and though it contains every thing necessary for a
Christian&rsquo;s salvation, yet there are in it some parts which
are not so easy to be understood; but require the assistance of
fit and proper persons to point out to the unlearned the proper
meaning of those passages.&nbsp; The explanation, however, of
these difficult passages will vary, according to the religious
notions of the person, to whom the application for assistance is
made.&nbsp; And as it is well known, that the Socinian, the
Independent, the Anabaptist, the Methodist, and other sects, all
think they derive the tenets of their respective religions from
the Bible, it is surely of importance, notwithstanding the
ostensible object of the two Societies is the same, for a
churchman to consider whom he assists in the explanation of the
Bible, and what channel he authorizes for its distribution; lest,
whilst the letter of the Gospel is distributed, the spirit of it
should be completely altered.</p>
<p><a name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 4</span>The
Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge certainly, holds forth
superior advantages to a churchman: First, Because it is a
Society which consists entirely of churchmen; Secondly, Because
Bibles can there be procured at a cheaper rate; Thirdly, Because
those Bibles are more useful; and, Fourthly, Because it furnishes
Prayer Books and Religious Tracts.</p>
<p>First, It is a Society which consists entirely of
churchmen.&nbsp; A Society formed of persons professing the same
system of religion, can have no other view than the promotion of
that religion.&nbsp; There will be no variety of interpretations
in essential points, no confusion occasioned among the unlearned
by different comments.&nbsp; The churchman will explain the
difficult and doubtful parts, if applied to for an explanation of
them, in the way prescribed by the best church
commentators.&nbsp; But, if not applied to for that specific
purpose, will rather recommend an attention to those parts of
Scripture, which point out the way to salvation, and which are so
clear and plain, that he who runs may read his duty.&nbsp; He
will circulate the Bible, because he firmly believes it will best
promote his religion, and that his religion prescribes the best
mode of obtaining eternal salvation.&nbsp; There can, therefore,
be no danger in a churchman subscribing to this Society, because
the views of all the members of it must be the same.&nbsp; On
this account, then, this Society must be considered as the most
proper channel through which a churchman should distribute the
Bible: and it does seem surprising, when the Church of England is
more effectually served by an union of churchmen with churchmen,
how any one of that persuasion can hesitate to prefer it.</p>
<p><a name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 5</span>Secondly,
It is the best, because it procures Bibles at a cheaper
rate.&nbsp; The comparative advantage of the two Societies in
this respect, have been so clearly brought forward by Mr. Norris,
in his Appendix to the Practical Exposition of the Bible Society,
that this shall be taken from it.&nbsp; A 12mo nonpareil Bible is
allowed to the Subscribers for Promoting Christian Knowledge for
3s. 3d., <a name="citation5a"></a><a href="#footnote5a"
class="citation">[5a]</a> but the British and Foreign Bible
Society expects from its subscribers 4s. 6d. <a
name="citation5b"></a><a href="#footnote5b"
class="citation">[5b]</a> for the same edition.&nbsp; In
purchasing, therefore, six Bibles, a subscriber to the former
would give 19s. 6d., but a subscriber to the latter would give
&pound;1. 7s.&nbsp; If a parochial subscription should be made,
the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge offers superior
advantages.&nbsp; Because it offers two-thirds of the collection
to be returned in books, valued at the reduced prices; whereas,
the British and Foreign Bible Society only offers one half; and
therefore, if the collection amounted to &pound;18, the Society
for Promoting Christian Knowledge, selling their Bibles for 3s.
3d., and allowing two-thirds of it to be returned in books, which
would be &pound;12, <a name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
6</span>would furnish 73 and nearly 74 Bibles; whilst the British
and Foreign Bible Society, selling their Bibles for 4s. 6d., and
only allowing one half to be returned in books, would, for the
collection of &pound;18, only furnish 40 Bibles.&nbsp; The
Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge would therefore allow
for the same collection 33 or nearly one half more Bibles than
the British and Foreign Bible Society; as, therefore, this
Society affords Bibles at a cheaper rate, and as the distribution
of them is the main object of both Societies, that Society must
clearly be the best, which affords the largest opportunities of
doing it.</p>
<p>Thirdly, It is the best, because it provides Bibles which are
more useful.&nbsp; It has been before observed, that there are
passages in the Bible which may admit of doubtful and different
interpretations.&nbsp; Surely, then, that Society is to be
esteemed the best, which affords the best comments on those
difficult passages.&nbsp; The Society for Promoting Christian
Knowledge furnishes Bibles with these notes and comments.&nbsp;
And there is now publishing by that Society, a most useful and
explanatory Family Bible, under the management of Dr. Mant and
Mr. D&rsquo;Oyley, which is furnished to the subscribers at a
very cheap rate; and which, if it were possible, it would be
desirable so far still to be reduced in price, as to allow it to
be in general circulation.&nbsp; For, the more the Bible is
explained by fit and able commentators, the more useful it is
rendered.&nbsp; Bibles, therefore, with notes and comments, are
the most useful; and as that Society provides them, it is clearly
the best channel through which a churchman would wish to
distribute a Bible.</p>
<p><a name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 7</span>Fourthly,
It is the best, because it provides Prayer Books and Religious
Tracts.&nbsp; When we consider that there is at present hardly a
town, or even a village, which is not visited by illiterate
teachers, who expound the Bible with more confidence than the
most able theologian, it surely becomes doubly necessary, if we
would preserve the poor of the Establishment in the religion of
their fathers, to provide them with a safeguard against false
interpretations.&nbsp; At one time it was argued by the advocates
of the Bible Society, that the Bible alone was the religion of
the Protestant, and ought to be alone distributed.&nbsp; But
those persons who were desirous of preserving the present Church
Establishment, and amongst those, particularly Dr. Marsh, made
every effort to increase the distribution of the Prayer
Book.&nbsp; And when we consider that it contains devotional
exercises in the true spirit of the Scripture; that it is heard
constantly at church; that it is designed equally for the closet;
and that no churchman can join in the service of the church
without it; surely it must be confessed that the Society which
provides these is the best.&nbsp; It may be said, that there is a
Society formed for the distribution of Prayer Books and Homilies,
and that a churchman, subscribing to the British and Foreign
Bible Society, may procure Prayer Books to accompany his Bibles
from that; but surely the Society which unites both in one must
be preferable to that which provides only one.&nbsp; Great
benefit is also to be derived from Religious Tracts.&nbsp; They
are useful helps, and sure and certain guides.&nbsp; That is,
certain as far as human intellect can guarantee them, as to the
doctrine <a name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 8</span>of
the Church of England.&nbsp; For no Tract is allowed to be issued
by this Society, without undergoing the strictest examination of
the most learned and orthodox men.&nbsp; Which must undoubtedly
be, to those churchmen who do not pretend to be wise above what
is written, nor wiser than any that have gone before, nor above
being guided, a very great recommendation.&nbsp; From what has
been observed, it will, it is to be hoped, be allowed, that the
Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge holds forth superior
advantages to the churchman; when it is considered, that it is
composed of churchmen only; that it furnishes Bibles with notes
and comments; that it sells those Bibles at a much cheaper rate;
and that it provides Prayer Books and Religious Tracts.</p>
<p>The British and Foreign Bible Society is composed of churchmen
and dissenters.&nbsp; The dissenter of every denomination is
admitted into it, and allowed to have at his disposal an equal
number of Bibles with the churchman.&nbsp; And if there be, as
every dissenting minister must acknowledge, some parts of the
Holy Scriptures, which the poor and unlearned cannot understand
without assistance, and the Bible be distributed by such a
variety of persons, professing different religions, and
consequently affording very different explanations, what
confusion must be occasioned!&nbsp; How must the poor be tossed
about by such various and strange doctrines!&nbsp; The British
Critic for November, 1815, in the remarks upon Mr.
Gisborne&rsquo;s letter to the Bishop of Gloucester, says,
&ldquo;As the most absurd and fatal errors which ever disgraced
the Christian Church, have every one of them been <a
name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 9</span>deduced from a
perverted interpretation of the Holy Scriptures; to place Bibles
for distribution in the hands of those who preach such doctrines,
and who can prove to the satisfaction of their deluded hearers,
that such doctrines are derived from Scripture, is to increase
the progress of error; and every such Bible becomes a curse and
not a blessing to its possessors.&nbsp; Most dangerous,
therefore, is it to the souls of the lower orders, by an union of
churchmen with such men as hold forth these fatal perversions, to
supply them with arms for their own destruction, and to give them
influence sufficient to use them with success.&nbsp; We do not
say that all dissenters are thus inclined; many, especially of
the older sort, are good and worthy men; but the daily increasing
numbers of furious fanatics are unhappily more than sufficient to
warrant our assertions.&rdquo;&nbsp; A churchman must believe,
that, in the Established Church, Christianity is to be found,
both as to its doctrine and discipline, in its purest form: and
he must also believe, that the further the doctrine of any sect
recedes from this standard, the further must it degenerate into
error.&nbsp; And the more the sectaries are increased, the more
will the Established Church be endangered.&nbsp; It may be said,
that if the doctrine and discipline of the Church be founded on
the Bible, why should it be alarmed at the extended distribution
of that Bible on which it is founded?&nbsp; That the doctrines
and discipline of the Church are founded on the Bible we are
proud to acknowledge, and ready to demonstrate; but that
Independency, Quakerism, Antinomianism, and Unitarianism are also
referred to by their several teachers to the same source, <a
name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 10</span>no one would
attempt to deny.&nbsp; When, therefore, by our co-operation, we
enable these sectaries to distribute the Holy Scriptures to a
vast extent, we enable them to undermine the Established Church,
by the means of those very Scriptures on which it is
founded.&nbsp; The sectary gains an influence over the poor, by
the opportunities afforded him by this Society.&nbsp; And every
churchman who subscribes his guinea to it, must suffer his
subscription to go to promote the views of the dissenter,
whatever they may be, as well as his own: it must go towards the
furtherance of whatever plan that Society may suggest.</p>
<p>Some persons have attempted to apologize for their belonging
to this Society, by saying, that their object was to watch over
and prevent any bad consequences which might otherwise happen
from it.&nbsp; But surely this is a most senseless notion; that,
because it is a Society which may be productive of much mischief,
they will add to the means which will promote it.&nbsp; Nature
will be nature; and a man, conscientiously attached to his
religion, will, if means are afforded him, find opportunities of
employing them towards the accomplishment of his purpose, though
ever so much watched.&nbsp; It therefore plainly appears, that
the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge is far preferable
to churchmen for the distribution of the Bible than the British
and Foreign Bible Society; not only from the great advantages
before mentioned, but because much danger to the Church
Establishment may be incurred by the latter, but cannot by the
former.</p>
<p>With regard to the other argument urged by the <a
name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 11</span>advocates for
the British and Foreign Bible Society; <i>viz.</i> The love and
harmony which, by such an union of churchmen with dissenters,
will be inspired.&nbsp; This may be proved to be as unfounded as
the other.&nbsp; Did this love and harmony only refer to social
acts, to kindness between man and man, it would certainly be a
most desirable object.&nbsp; For, as far as the calls of society
demand, or humanity can claim, so far should such an union be
strongly recommended.&nbsp; Distress ought to mark the object,
and not the sect.&nbsp; And if that object be worthy, or in real
distress, whether churchman or dissenter, he ought to be
comforted and relieved.&nbsp; But surely, with regard to every
religious transaction, each ought to be perfectly distinct.&nbsp;
Let the dissenter have as free and complete a toleration as
possible, and an undisturbed opportunity of observing and obeying
the rites and precepts of his religion; but let not the churchman
contribute his means to assist the dissenter in the extension of
his religion, at the hazard of supplanting his own.&nbsp;
Whatever ideas may be afloat in the world, that all religions are
to be equally encouraged, and that there are no safeguards, no
protection to be granted to any one in particular, let not a
churchman harbour such.&nbsp; It may be wise and prudent for a
dissenter to adopt such sentiments, but perfectly unwise and
imprudent in a churchman.</p>
<p>The union of all sects and denominations of Christians to
distribute the Word of God, has an imposing sound, and is well
calculated to seduce the unwary, and to deceive the good.&nbsp;
But, to form a complete and safe union in any scheme, it is
absolutely necessary that all the consequences of such an act <a
name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 12</span>should
certainly tend to the promotion of mutual intention and interest:
and such can certainly not be said of the union here mentioned,
because the purposes and interests of the various parts of it
totally differ.&nbsp; So far then from the Bible Society
producing any union, it sows widely the seeds of discord.&nbsp;
It has already divided the national Church; and what is the
spirit which animates it, may be seen by the variety of pamphlets
circulated by its abettors, and by the variety of speeches made
at every Auxiliary Meeting.</p>
<p>Whatever conciliation it may have effected amongst dissenters,
it assuredly has had a contrary effect amongst churchmen.&nbsp;
For there has not been, for a considerable time, a measure
brought forward which has created such a division amongst
them.&nbsp; A division, which, if continued, may, and most likely
will, be productive of the most fatal consequences to the
Established Church.&nbsp; A Society, which will instigate and
cause such violent and unbecoming animadversions, as are made not
only from churchmen to churchmen, but from the clergy of a
certain diocese to their diocesan, <a name="citation12"></a><a
href="#footnote12" class="citation">[12]</a> must hold forth and
threaten the most alarming and dangerous consequences.&nbsp; It
has already had the effect of creating a division amongst the
members of the Established Church, but has not diminished the
number of the dissenters.&nbsp; It therefore may with truth be
said, that the British and Foreign Bible Society cannot with
justice appropriate to itself the merit of either exclusively
distributing the Bible, or of inspiring universal love and
harmony.&nbsp; A churchman may, therefore, fairly refuse to
subscribe <a name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
13</span>to it, without deserving to be reproached as an enemy to
the distribution of the Bible, as being a bigot, or being
regardless of the spiritual welfare of the poor.&nbsp; He may
say, &ldquo;I love and revere the Bible as much as any person can
do, and am as ready to associate for its distribution; but I
wish, whilst I am promoting this laudable work, to perform at the
same time my duties as a churchman.&nbsp; And, therefore, as the
Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge consists entirely of
churchmen; will provide me with Bibles at a cheaper rate: such as
are more useful, from their notes and comments; and will also
provide me with Prayer Books and Religious Tracts, I shall prefer
that; because no harm can thereby happen to the Established
Church; and because I shall thus be enabled to do my duty as a
Christian, and at the same time my duty as a churchman.&nbsp;
Whilst, by uniting in the distribution of the Bible, through the
hands of sectaries of every description, I should consider
myself, by promoting their means of conversion, in every convert
who was made, or in every intention formed by them for drawing
persons from the Established Church, not only an assistant, but
an accessary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>These are certainly very fair and reasonable objections to a
churchman&rsquo;s subscribing to the British and Foreign Bible
Society.&nbsp; If there were no other Society formed for the
distribution of the Bible, the case would be different.&nbsp; But
since there is one, which offers superior advantages, and which
affords him an opportunity of performing the duties of a
churchman, at the same time that he is performing the duties of a
Christian, there is abundant reason <a name="page14"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 14</span>for his rejection of the one Society,
and his adoption of the other.</p>
<p>There is one other plan proposed by the British and Foreign
Bible Society, which requires to be shortly noticed; <i>viz.</i>
The pennies collected from the poor.&nbsp; If the representations
of Mr. Gisborne are correct, as to the flourishing state of the
Auxiliary Bible Society, that their revenue amounted in 1815 to
&pound;124,019. 7s. 7d.; that &pound;26,687. 16s. 5d. was
expended for the foreign department; that there was left for home
consumption annually the sum of &pound;97,331. 11s; 2d.; that, in
addition to this income, there are exchequer bills to the amount
of &pound;33,822. 3s. 8d., besides funded property to the amount
of &pound;10,000 more: with such an immense sum, an
unappropriated surplus of &pound;43,000 and upwards, and an
income for home consumption of &pound;90,000 and upwards, it may
be fairly asked, for what Christian purpose are the poor to be
taxed a penny a week, in support of a Society whose income
exceeds it expenditure?&nbsp; What reason can there be to tax the
paupers of this kingdom to supply foreign nations with
Bibles?&nbsp; There is no poor family in the kingdom, to whom 4s.
6d. is not, at the end of the year, a real object, in the
purchase of clothing for children, payment of rent, or procuring
food and fuel.&nbsp; To deduct such a sum, therefore, from a poor
family, is a cruel, a wicked, and an unchristian act.&nbsp; If
the poor cannot claim a Bible gratuitously, for what reason is
&pound;90,000 taken every year from the pockets of the
rich?&nbsp; It is greatly to be feared, that the <a
name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 15</span>real purport
of this vexatious impost has a more mischievous tendency; and
though there are some who have united in this scheme, more from
error in judgment, than from badness of intention, yet there are
others, whose aim and ambition it is to puritanize the whole
community, and to raise the fabric of enthusiasm upon the ruins
of Church and State. <a name="citation15"></a><a

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project

LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium

with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org 

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary 
Archive Foundation

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
